## Considerations

* The Data set is a practice data set that allows users to create or test models for Financial Fraud Detections and for illustrative purposes only.
* I used this data aset to demostrate fraud analysis and how to interpret a confusion matrix for flagging fraud and testing the predication outcomes.
* The dataset contained more than 6 million transactions.
